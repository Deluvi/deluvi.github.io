      <description>On my first blog post, I mentioned that my first project for this website is to experiment with some technologies from the Indieweb. The technology that attracted me the most is Webmention.
In this article, I will first elaborate on what are webmentions. Then, I will explain how to send them. Finally, I will show the different ways to receive them when using a static website.
What is Webmention? Webmention is a web standard that allows having interactions in a decentralized way.</description>

      <description>Hello people! This is Deluvi speaking. Welcome to my first blog post!
I have been inspired by the Indieweb movement to make my own website. I really like their ideas of owning our own data and content and not letting companies owning them for convenience&amp;rsquo;s sake, since it can be as simple to share on our own website with the help of modern tooling.
In this first blog post, I will share my current setup of this static website.</description>
