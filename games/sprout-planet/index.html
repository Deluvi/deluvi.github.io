<div class="p-summary">A peaceful game about waking up a planet</div>
<div class="e-content">
<p>This game has been made during the gamejam <a href="https://itch.io/jam/cree-le-jeu">Cr√©e Le Jeu 2019</a>. It was my first gamejam where there was a meat-space meeting at the beginning of the jam. This meeting was great: we pitched the games that we wanted to develop during the jam and anyone could help us to improve our concept. It was during this meeting that I met the graphics person with whom I made this game. We also met our soon to be sound partner who made all the sound effects and the music for the game.</p>

<p>It was the first time that I used <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> in a complete project. I have been practicing with Godot for some time but it was on small prototypes and tutorials. It was a pleasure to code on Godot (the editor is really good) and it&rsquo;s so cool that you can export for the web on HTML5, as the majority of the people are very lazy and/or paranoid and don&rsquo;t want to run executable code from a stranger of the Internet.</p>

<p>The game is about this planet that you can click on it to wake it up.</p>

<p>While we went a bit off-topic from the subject of the Gamejam, we had a lot of fun when we made it and we are proud of it, which is the most important things!</p>

<p>You can play this game <a href="https://deluvi.itch.io/sprout-planet">on Itch.io</a>. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/Deluvi/forest-clicker">on Github</a></p>
